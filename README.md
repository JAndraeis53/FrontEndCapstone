This is Boredom Buster, my Front End capstone for the Nashville Software School's Full Time Web Design Cohort 49. 

For my capstone, I built a React application with HTML and CSS during a two week sprint with the goal of achieving a Minimally Viable Product (MVP) that had full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.

With so much happening so often in the city, it can be hard to remember all that the city has to offer, let alone choose from them. This app aims to help socialites organize their adventures around the metropolis, giving them new and unique experiences.

Using identifying tags chosen by the user, this application was designed to pull locations from a database that matched a users preference and present new and unique Nashville locations for the user to choose to visit in the future. These locations offered an address, a brief description, and the ability for the user to leave a review of the location or remove the location from their list of selected locations.
